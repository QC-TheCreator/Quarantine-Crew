# Welcome to the Contents Page

### This is just a test page to get things started.
GitHub pages allows us to host whatever webpage we want (the provide a free domain).



For example, if we want to put secret things in the game and want to have the players follow bread crumbs to the prize, using a website like this could be interesting.
I could create an input which if the player has the right `keyword` would take them to a page which will provide further clues, or whatever.

*(also a thought would be perhaps theres a page here which is unreadable because its encrypted; you could have the decryption cipher somewhere in the game which would be used to read the website. Or smth)*

It's **free** without a timelimit so if you think of something you could use this for lmk, otherwise dw.
