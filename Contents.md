# Welcome to the Contents Page

### This is just a test page to get things started.
We can use GitHub Pages to host whatever webpages we want. We can also updated it whenever we want.

For example, if we want to put secret things in the game and want to have the players follow bread crumbs to the prize, using a website like this would help us.
I could create an input which if the player has the right `code` will take them to a page which will provide further clues, etc.

(also a thought would be perhaps theres a page here which is unreadable because its encrypted; you could have the decryption cipher somewhere in the game which would be used to read the website. Or smth)
